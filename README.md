# Hangman Game in Python

This is a simple Hangman game implemented in Python. The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and the player has to guess the letters in the word.

## How to Play

1.  **Clone or download the repository:** If this is in a repository, clone it. Otherwise, download the `hangman.py` file.
2.  **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using `python hangman.py`.
3.  **Guess letters:** The game will display the current state of the word with underscores for unguessed letters. Enter a letter and press Enter.
4.  **Game feedback:** The game will tell you if your guess is correct or incorrect. Incorrect guesses will reduce your lives.
5.  **Hints:** Some words will have a hint displayed.
6.  **Win or lose:** The game continues until you guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
7.  **Play again:** After each game, you'll be asked if you want to play again.

## Features

*   **Random word selection:** The game chooses a word randomly from a predefined list using `random.choice()`.
*   **Set operations:** Uses sets (`word_letters`, `alphabet`, `used_letters`) for efficient tracking of guessed letters and the alphabet.
*   **Input validation:** Handles invalid user input (non-alphabetical characters and already guessed letters).
*   **Limited lives:** The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (default is 6).
*   **Word progress display:** Shows the current state of the word with underscores (e.g., "c _ t").
*   **Game over messages:** Clear messages are displayed when the player wins or loses.
*   **Play again feature:** Allows the player to play multiple games.
*   **Hints:** Provides hints for certain word categories (e.g., hyphenated words, programming languages).

## Word List

The `word_list` contains the words that can be chosen for the game.  You can modify this list to add or remove words.  The list currently includes regular words as well as compound or technical terms (hyphenated words).

## Hints

Hints are provided based on categories of words.  Currently, hints are given for compound words (words containing a hyphen) and programming languages. You can add more categories and hints in the `play_hangman()` function.

## Possible Enhancements

*   **More Word Categories:** Expand the `word_list` to include more diverse categories of words (e.g., animals, countries, foods).  This would make the game more challenging and 
       interesting.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Implement difficulty levels.  This could be done by:
    *   Adjusting the number of lives the player starts with.
    *   Using a word list that contains words of varying lengths or complexities.
    *   Providing fewer hints or making hints less specific.
*   **GUI:** Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using a library like Tkinter, Pygame, or PyQt. A GUI would make the game more visually appealing and user-friendly.
*   **Improved Hints:** Make the hints more specific or provide multiple hints.  For example, instead of "This is a compound word," you could give a clue related to the word's meaning.
*   **Scorekeeping:** Track the player's score (number of wins, win/loss ratio, etc.).  You could even store scores in a file to allow players to track their progress over time.
*   **Sound Effects:** Add sound effects for correct guesses, incorrect guesses, winning, and losing.  The `playsound` library can be used for this.
*   **Timer:** Implement a timer to add an extra challenge.  The player would have a limited amount of time to guess each letter.
*   **Multiplayer Mode:**  Allow two players to play against each other.
